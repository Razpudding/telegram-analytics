# telegram-analytics
This tool analyzes telegram chat data and creates data visualizations using D3.js, to provide insights about the conversation.

This tool will only work if you provide a tsv sourcefile with telegram chat data in it that has the following headerline:
name	date	message

I will upload an example file later.

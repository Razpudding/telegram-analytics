# telegram-analytics
This tool analyzes telegram chat data and creates data visualizations using D3.js, to provide insights about the conversation.
Follow steps 1, 5-7 to see an example of how this programme works

Take the following steps if you want to have your own telegram data analyzed:

1. Clone this repo to a folder on your computer
2. Extract data from telegram using this tool: https://github.com/pigpagnet/save-telegram-chat-history
3. Save the file in the same folder as this repo
4. Edit index.js variable sourceTSV so that it points to the file you just saved
5. Install budo in this folder (will add more instructions on how to do this later)
6. Run budo, copy the ip address
7. Paste the address in your browser and presto!
